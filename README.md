# OpenGL Solar System Simulation

This project is a solar system simulation developed for the final assignment of CIS 262. It uses OpenGL and C++ to create an immersive experience where the user can navigate through space while observing the planets orbiting the sun.

## Features

- **3D Solar System:** Explore a realistic 3D representation of the solar system.
- **User Interaction:** Navigate through the skybox to get a closer look at the planets.
- **Orbiting Planets:** Watch as the planets orbit the sun, creating a dynamic and visually engaging simulation.
- **Rotating Planets:** Each planet not only orbits the sun but also rotates around its own axis, adding an extra layer of realism.

## Controls
- W/A/S/D: Navigate forward, left, backward, and right, respectively.
- Mouse Movement: Look around in the skybox.
  
## Dependencies
- OpenGL: The core graphics library used for rendering.
- C++: The programming language used for implementation.
  
## Acknowledgments
Thanks to the CIS 262 course for providing the opportunity to work on this engaging project.
